# Assignment-1

This project is a portfolio of my own which shows the necessary things to convince a copan to hire me such as an about me section so on and so forth. With this, I am able to present mself better and show the company I am worthy of getting hired b them.
 
## Design Process
The design I created was based on a design I had been thinking of ever since I did the Cybersecurity Fundamentals assignment in Year 1.1 as I did ot like using Wix.com but instead wanted something I could do myself, as well as the FP1 assignment where we had to create our own website. I feel like this design is simple but nice as it uses basic colours to show my favourite simplicity.

## Features

My project has many pages.
The Home page, About Me, Skills and Traits, Projects, Achievements as well as the Contact Form.
Each of them describes a bit about myself showing what would make me a suitable candidate for a job.
 

## Technologies Used

I used HTML,Css and Javascript to complete this project.
## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Form" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
    3. Try to submit the form with no email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that it redirects you to the "Home" page.
